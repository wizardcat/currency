A currrency exchange rate table.
A pet app. The application makes an API request once an hour and stores the data in localStorage. When the page is refreshed, if it is too early to update the data, the API request is not made. When the data changes, the data in the table is updated.
By pressing the button, the data is forcibly updated and the time counter is reset.
